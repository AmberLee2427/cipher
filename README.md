## 1. The House in the Woods
The cabin stands in quiet defiance of the outside world. Hidden deep within the forest, it sits like a secret, the kind you find when you are no longer looking for one. The walls are thick with solitude, and the wood creaks softly under the weight of memories. It is simple, this place, but perfect in its simplicity. The fire crackles in the corner, warming the room with its steady, rhythmic breath, while the air smells of pine and earth. The rain, always the rain, taps at the window, persistent, unyielding, like a heartbeat.
It feels like home. But more than that—it feels like freedom.
The carving on the doorframe catches my eye again, as it always does. A line in a language I do not speak, but whose meaning is clear, even if I don’t fully understand the words. It says, “Me kākahu koe i te oati kāore koe e whakama i ahau, kāore hoki koe e whakaiti i ahau. E whakaatu ana koe i te whakaute mā te kore wehi ki te wero.”
I read it slowly, over and over, as I have many times before. It is a promise, a reminder, perhaps to myself. It tells me that I will not be ashamed here. That I will not be diminished. It speaks to the way I am when I stand in this place: free of judgment, free of the weight that so often drapes over me in the world outside.
I take a deep breath, and the smell of damp earth fills the air. Through the window, the forest is alive, teeming with creatures that move in the shadows. Some are beautiful. Others are dangerous. All are free. The trees stretch their limbs toward the sky, reaching and twisting with a grace I cannot even begin to understand. The wind howls through the branches, relentless, powerful.
The rain comes down in sheets, its sound relentless, washing over the world outside like a great cleansing. I cannot remember the last time I saw the sun here—perhaps it has been weeks, or months, or longer. But it doesn’t matter. The rain makes everything feel alive, more real than it ever could be when the world is dry and still.
Inside, I sit by the fire, watching the droplets dance on the glass, listening to the roar of the storm outside. I write in my journal the memory I can’t speak out loud. The pain, the betrayals, but most importantly the acquiescence that I used to lie to myself about what was happening. The lack of fight that made me complicit. But when that secret threatens to pull me down, when the memories become too real and I start to feel a warm breath on my neck, the rain gets louder. My Rain.
I close my eyes for a moment and feel the pulse of the world around me. The rain is a kind of music, a rhythm that beats through the walls of the cabin, a reminder that I, too, am alive. It washes away everything I left behind when I walked into this place—the shame, the doubt, the expectations of others. Here, there is only the rain and the forest, the pulse of the earth beneath my feet.
I stand up, my feet quiet on the wooden floor, and walk to the door. My hand touches the cool, weathered wood of the doorframe, where the carving sits like an oath. A promise. I reach for the handle, my fingers trembling slightly, and pull.
The door opens with a creak, and the rain pours in.
For a moment, the world is nothing but water and wind. It swirls around me, cold and powerful. The forest seems to draw closer, its wild energy filling the room, urging me to step outside, to let go of everything, to join the rhythm of the storm.
I stand there, in the doorway, my feet firm on the threshold. The rain stings my skin, but it is not uncomfortable. It is cleansing. It is freedom.
And for the first time in a long time, I feel like I can breathe.
The door stays open.
